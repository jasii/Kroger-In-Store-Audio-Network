# Kroger-In-Store-Audio-Network

I wanted to see how many different songs play at my store at work. It feels like I am constantly hearing the same songs on repeat.

First part was to figure out how to get my data. I got my old pixel 2 phone, It has the Now Playing feature where it constantly picks up songs and displays them on your notification bar / home screen.I factory reset it and made it it's own google account and put my brother's secondary cell phone number SIM card that he pays for in it so I have data. 
Then I got an app called Now Playing List from the Play Store. That let's me save a history of all the songs as a CSV file.

Next I charged it up put it in my store, specifically in the book keepers office on top of the speaker that plays all the music and turned the volume up a bit. This room also is the most quiet, in terms of people talking over the music and unwanted noise. ALSO it's secured with a lock.

I had it recording data from around 6:30am yesterday until today at 12:30pm and the phone's battery only dropped about 15%. I left it in there to record more data, but I exported and sent myself what I had gathered so far.
