# Kroger-In-Store-Audio-Network

I wanted to see how many different songs play at my store at work. It feels like I am constantly hearing the same songs on repeat.

First part was to figure out how to get my data. I got my old Pixel 2 phone, It has the Now Playing feature where it constantly picks up songs and displays them on your notification bar / home screen.
Then I got an app called Now Playing List from the Play Store. That let's me save a history of all the songs as a CSV file.

Next I charged it up put it in my store, specifically in the book keepers office on top of the speaker that plays all the music and turned the volume up a bit. This room also is the most quiet, in terms of people talking over the music and unwanted noise. ALSO it's secured with a lock, so nobody would take the phone.
